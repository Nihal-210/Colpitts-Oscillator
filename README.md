# Colpitts Oscillator

## Project Overview

This project documents the design and hardware implementation of a **Colpitts Oscillator** using a BJT and an LC tank circuit. The oscillator generates sustained sinusoidal oscillations based on the Barkhausen criterion and is widely used in RF and communication circuits.

## Features

* Hardware implementation using discrete components (BJT, capacitors, inductor).
* Verified oscillation waveform and frequency using a CRO.
* Analysis of frequency stability, amplitude, and effect of component tolerances.

## Tools & Components

* BJT in common-emitter configuration
* Capacitors & Inductor (LC tank circuit)
* CRO for measurement and testing
* DC Power Supply, Breadboard/PCB
